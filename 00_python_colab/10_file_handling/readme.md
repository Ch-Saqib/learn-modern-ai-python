#File Handling in Python: A Comprehensive Tutorial with Examples

File handling is essential for reading and writing data to files, enabling persistent storage. Python provides built-in functions and methods to handle files efficiently. This tutorial covers the fundamentals with examples.

---

1. Opening a File

Use the open() function to open a file. Specify the mode (read, write, append, etc.).

- Modes:

  - r: Read (default)

  - w: Write (Opens the file for writing. Creates the file if it doesn't exist, or overwrites it if it does.)

  - a: Append (Opens the file for appending. Creates the file if it doesn't exist, or adds to it if it does.)

  - x: Exclusive creation (fails if file exists)

  - b: Binary mode (Used with the other modes (e.g., "rb", "wb") for working with binary files.)

  - +: Update mode (Can be combined with other modes (e.g., "r+", "w+") to allow both reading and writing.)
    <br>

###OK, Let's create a file in Colab.

<br>

**`w: Write mode`**. Opens the file for writing. Creates the file if it doesn't exist, or overwrites it if it does.
"""

file = open("new_file.txt", "w")

"""###Writing to Files:

To write to a file, open it in write ("w") or append ("a") mode.

write(string): Writes the given string to the file.
"""

file.write("Hello, world!\n") # \n creates a new line
file.write("This is another line.\n")
file.close()

"""writelines(list): Writes a list of strings to the file."""

lines = ["Line 1: Karachi\n", "Line 2: Lahore\n", "Line 3: Peshawar\n"]
file = open("new_file.txt", "a") # run with mode w, and see the result
file.writelines(lines)
file.close()

"""#### Uptill now we have created a file with 'w' & 'a' mode and also write some lines in it.

#### Now let start reading the file what we have created earlier.

Run the below line of code and see the error ðŸ˜ž

Explain why?
"""

file = open("my_file.txt", "r") # Opens "my_file.txt" in read mode ("r")

"""So lets correct the name of the file ðŸ˜€"""

file = open("new_file.txt", "r") # Opens "my_file.txt" in read mode ("r")

content = file.read()
print(content)

line = file.readline()
print(line)

###Here you need to know the concept of file pointer

---

In Python, a `file pointer` (also called a `file cursor` or `file position indicator`) is an internal marker that keeps track of the `current position` in a file where the next read or write operation will occur. When you open a file, the file pointer is initialized to a specific position (`usually 0, the beginning of the file`), and it moves automatically as you read from or write to the file.

<br>

Key Concepts:

1. Starting Position:

- r (read mode): Pointer starts at 0 (beginning of the file).
- a (append mode): Pointer starts at the end of the file.
- w (write mode): The file is truncated (erased), and the pointer starts at 0.

2. How It Moves:

- When you read/write data, the pointer moves forward by the number of bytes/characters processed.
- Example: Reading 10 characters moves the pointer 10 positions forward.

3. Manual Control:

- Use seek(offset) to move the pointer to a specific byte position.
- Use tell() to check the current pointer position.

###Move pointer back to start.
"""

file.seek(0)

"""###Check the file cursor/pointer position after running seek(0) method."""

print("Position after seek(0):", file.tell())

line = file.readline()
print(line)

"""### readlines(): Reads all lines into a list."""

file.seek(0) # First move the pointer to the start

lines = file.readlines()
for line in lines:
print(line)

file = open("new_file.txt", "r")
for line in file: # Iterating directly over the file reads line by line
print(line.strip()) # .strip() removes leading/trailing whitespace

"""Closing Files:

- It's crucial to close files after you're finished with them. This releases system resources and ensures that data is properly written to the disk. The `close()` method is used for this:
  """

file.close()

"""### Additional Tips

- Exclusive Creation (x mode):

### Best Practices:

- Use `with` for automatic cleanup.
- Handle exceptions to avoid crashes.
  """

try:
with open('unique.txt', 'x') as file:
file.write('Created exclusively!')
except FileExistsError:
print("File already exists.")

"""### The `with` Statement (Context Manager):

- The best practice for file handling is to use the `with` statement. This ensures that the file is `automatically closed, even if errors occur`.
  """

with open("new_file.txt", "r") as file:
content = file.read()
print(content)

# File is automatically closed here

"""The above cell use the `with` statement which close the file after use, let's validate it."""

file.tell() # will produce error, file is already closed because of with statement

"""### Example: Copying a file"""

def copy_file(source_path, destination_path):
try:
with open(source_path, "r") as source_file, open(destination_path, "w") as dest_file:
for line in source_file:
dest_file.write(line)
print(f"File '{source_path}' copied to '{destination_path}' successfully.")
except FileNotFoundError:
print(f"Error: Source file '{source_path}' not found.")
except Exception as e:
print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

copy_file("unique.txt", "unique_copy.txt")

"""## Full Example: File Operations Demo"""

# Create and write to a file

with open('demo.txt', 'w') as file:
file.write('Python File Handling\n')
file.write('Line 1\nLine 2\n')

# Read and print content

with open('demo.txt', 'r') as file:
print("Content:")
print(file.read())

# Append a new line

with open('demo.txt', 'a') as file:
file.write('Appended line\n')

# Read lines using seek

with open('demo.txt', 'r+') as file:
file.seek(0)
print("First line:", file.readline())

"""# Conclusion

- Pythonâ€™s file handling is straightforward with **`open(), read(), write(), and close()`**. Always use the **`with`** statement for safety and leverage exception handling for robustness. Experiment with modes and methods to manage files effectively!
