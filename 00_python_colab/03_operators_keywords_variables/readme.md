# **Operator and Operand**

In Python (and programming in general), an operand is a value or variable that an operator acts on. Think of it like this:

- **Operator**: A symbol that performs an operation (e.g., +, -, \*, /).
- **Operand**: The value(s) or variable(s) that the operator works with.

## **Key Points:**

- Operands are the "inputs" for an operator.
- The number of operands depends on the operator:
  - **Unary operators** (e.g., not, -) work with one operand.
  - **Binary operators** (e.g., +, -, \*, /) work with two operands.

## **Unary Operators**

Unary operators work with one operand (a single value or variable). They perform operations on just one thing.

## **Examples:**

1.  **Negative (-):** \* Changes the sign of the operand.
    """

x = 5
y = -x # y is now -5
print("y = ", y)

"""2. **Logical NOT (not):** \* Reverses a boolean value.
"""

a = True
b = not a # b is now False
print("b = ", b)

"""## **Bitwise NOT (~):**

- Inverts the bits of a number (used in binary operations).
  """

x: int = 5 # Binary: 0101
y: int = ~x # y is now -6 (binary: 1010, but in two's complement form)
print("y = ", y)

"""You can print an integer as a binary number in Python using the `bin()` function. Here's an example:

The binary string is prefixed with `'0b'` to indicate that it's a binary number.
"""

print("bin(x) = ",bin(x), type(bin(x)))

num: int = x
print(format(num, 'b')) # Output: 1010
print(f"{num:b}") # Output: 1010

"""## **Binary Operators**

Binary operators work with two operands (two values or variables). They perform operations between two things.

### **Examples:**

1. **Arithmetic Operators (+, -, \*, /, etc.):**

   - Perform basic math operations.

2. **Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, etc.):**

   - Compare two values and return True or False.

3. **Logical Operators (and, or):**

   - Combine boolean values.

4. **Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, etc.):**
   - Assign values to variables or perform operations while assigning.

<br>

Note: (we will see these operators in action in next topic)

## **Key Difference:**

1.  **Unary Operators**: Work with one operand (e.g., -x, not a).
2.  **Binary Operators**: Work with two operands (e.g., a + b, x > y).

# **Operators in Python**

Operators in Python are `symbols` used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports several types of operators:

##**1. Arithmetic Operators**
Used for basic mathematical operations.

<br>

| Operator | Name                | Example                           |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| +        | Addition            | 5 + 2 = 7                         |
| -        | Subtraction         | 5 - 2 = 3                         |
| \*       | Multiplication      | 5 \* 2 = 10                       |
| /        | Division (float)    | 5 / 2 = 2.5                       |
| //       | Floor Division      | 5 // 2 = 2 (removes decimal part) |
| %        | Modulus (remainder) | 5 % 2 = 1                         |
| \*\*     | Exponentiation      | 5 \*\* 2 = 25                     |
|          |                     |                                   |

<br>

### **Example**

"""

a: int = 10
b: int = 3
print("a + b = ", a + b) # 13 Addition
print("a - b = ", a - b) # 7 Subtraction
print("a _ b = ", a _ b) # 30 Multiplication
print("a / b = ", a / b) # 3.3333333333333335
print("a // b = ", a // b) # 3 Floor Division
print("a % b = ", a % b) # 1 Modulus (remainder)
print("a % b = ", a \*_ b) # 1000 Exponentiation (10 _ 10 \* 10)

"""## **2. Comparison (Relational) Operators**
Used to compare two values.

<br>

| Operator | Name                  | Example        |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| ==       | Equal                 | 5 == 5 → True  |
| !=       | Not equal             | 5 != 3 → True  |
| >        | Greater than          | 5 > 3 → True   |
| <        | Less than             | 5 < 3 → False  |
| >=       | Greater than or equal | 5 >= 5 → True  |
| <=       | Less than or equal    | 5 <= 3 → False |
|          |                       |                |
|          |                       |                |

<br>

### **Example**

"""

x: int = 10
y: int = 5

print("x == y = ", x == y) # False, Equal
print("x != y = ", x != y) # True, Not equal
print("x > y = ", x > y) # True, Greater than
print("x < y = ", x < y) # False, Less than
print("x >= y = ", x >= y) # True, Greater than or equal
print("x <= y = ", x <= y) # False, Less than or equal

"""## **3. Logical Operators**
Used to combine conditional statements.

<br>

| Operator | Name        | Example                   |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| and      | Logical AND | (5 > 3 and 10 > 5) → True |
| or       | Logical OR  | (5 > 3 or 10 < 5) → True  |
| not      | Logical NOT | not(5 > 3) → False        |

<br>

### **Example**

"""

x: bool = True
y: bool = False

print("x and y = ", x and y) # False
print("x or y = ", x or y) # True
print("not x = ", not x) # False

"""## **4. Assignment Operators**
Used to assign values to variables.

<br>

| Operator | Example | Equivalent To |
| -------- | ------- | ------------- |
| =        | x = 5   | x = 5         |
| +=       | x += 3  | x = x + 3     |
| -=       | x -= 3  | x = x - 3     |
| \*=      | x \*= 3 | x = x \* 3    |
| /=       | x /= 3  | x = x / 3     |
| //=      | x //= 3 | x = x // 3    |
|          |         |               |
|          |         |               |

"""

x = 5
print("Assignment: x = 5 ",x) # Output: 5

x += 3 # Equivalent to x = x + 3
print("Addition Assignment: x += 3 ",x) # Output: 8

x -= 3 # Equivalent to x = x - 3
print("Subtraction Assignment: x -= 3 ",x) # Output: 5

x _= 3 # Equivalent to x = x _ 3
print("Multiplication Assignment: x \*= 3 ",x) # Output: 15

x /= 3 # Equivalent to x = x / 3
print("Division Assignment: x /= 3 ",x) # Output: 5.0

x //= 3 # Equivalent to x = x // 3
print("Floor Division Assignment: x //= 3 ",x) # Output: 1.0

"""Why Use Shorthand Operators?

- `Readability`: Makes the code more concise and easier to read.
- `Efficiency`: Reduces the need to repeat the variable name.
- `Common Practice`: Widely used in Python and other programming languages.

## **5. Identity Operators**

Used to compare `memory locations.`

<br>

| Operator | Name                                                         | Example    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| is       | Returns True if objects have the same memory location        | x is y     |
| is not   | Returns True if objects do not have the same memory location | x is not y |

### **Example**

"""

a: list = [1, 2, 3]
b: list = [1, 2, 3]
c: list = a

print("a is c = ",a is c) # True (same object, sharing same memmory space)
print("a is b = ",a is b) # False (different objects, seperate memmory space)
print("a == b = ", a == b) # True (same values, different memmory space but having same vlaues)
print("a is not b = ", a is not b) # True (True because of different memmory space, although having same memmory space)

print('\n-----\n') # seperator for better output readability

print("id(a) = ", id(a))
print("id(b) = ", id(b))
print("id(c) = ", id(c))

"""## **6. Membership Operators**
Used to check if a value is in a sequence (list, tuple, set, dictionary, etc.).

<br>

| Operator | Name                                         | Example       |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------- |

print("my_string = ", my_string) # Operation Badar
print("'O' in my_string = ", 'O' in my_string) # True
print("'Hello' not in my_string = ", 'Hello' not in my_string) # True

"""# **Python Keywords**

Keywords in Python are `reserved words` that have special meanings and serve specific purposes in the language syntax. Python keywords cannot be used as the names of variables, functions, and classes or any other identifier.
"""

import keyword

# Line continuation (`\`) allows printing a statement over multiple lines, improving code readability without breaking the string.

print("The list of \
keywords is : ")

# printing all keywords at once using "kwlist()"

print(keyword.kwlist)

"""You cant use keywords/ reserved words as variable name.
Uncomment below line to see error
"""

#and: bool = True

"""# **Python Variables**

In Python, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution. A variable is essentially a name that is assigned to a value. Unlike many other programming languages, **Python variables do not require explicit declaration of type. The type of the variable is `inferred` based on the value assigned.**

(**`inferred`** _meaning deduce or conclude (something) from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements._)

Variables act as placeholders for data. They allow us to store and reuse values in our program.

<br>

## **Rules for Naming Variables**

To use variables effectively, we must follow Python’s naming rules:

- Variable names can only contain `letters, digits and underscores` (`_`).
- A variable name `cannot` start with a `digit`.
- Variable names are `case-sensitive` (`myVar` and `myvar` are different).
- Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, else, for) as variable names.

```python
# Valid variable names
name = "Alice"
_age = 25
salary2024 = 50000
my_variable = "Python"

# Invalid variable names
2name = "Bob"          # ❌ Starts with a digit
my-variable = "Error"  # ❌ Contains a hyphen
class = "CS101"        # ❌ Uses a reserved keyword
```

## **Different naming conventions**

## **Special Naming Cases**

<br>

| Type                       | Example        | Used For                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Regular Variable           | total_cost     | General use                              |
| Constant                   | PI = 3.14159   | Constants                                |
| Class Name                 | BankAccount    | Class names                              |
| Private Variable           | \_password     | Internal use (not enforced)              |
| Private with Name Mangling | \_\_secret_key | Avoid accidental overrides in subclasses |
| Special Method             | \_\_init\_\_   | Built-in methods                         |

<br>
<br>

## Summary of Naming Conventions

| Convention            | Used For                              | Example                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| snake_case            | Variables & functions                 | user_name, total_price        |
| CamelCase             | Classes                               | BankAccount, DataScienceModel |
| UPPER_CASE            | Constants                             | MAX_SPEED, PI                 |
| \_single_underscore   | Private variable (by convention)      | \_config                      |
| \_\_double_underscore | Name mangling (avoid external access) | \_\_password                  |
| \_\_dunder\_\_        | Special methods                       | \_\_init\_\_, \_\_str\_\_     |

Here are the naming conventions in Python with their respective names:

1. **CapWords** or **PascalCase**: Class names
2. **snake_case**: Variable names, function names, method names, module names, package names
3. **UPPER_CASE**: Constant names
4. **dunder** (double underscore): Special method names (e.g. `__init__`, `__str__`)

<br>

It's worth noting that the official Python style guide, PEP 8, recommends using **`CapWords`** for `class names` and **`snake_case`** for `variable names`, `function names`, and `other identifiers`.

[PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

## **Assigning Different Values**

We can assign different values to multiple variables simultaneously, making the code concise and easier to read.
"""

x, y, z = 1, 2.5, "Python" # Using type hints while assigning mutiple variables simultaneously cause and error invalid syntax

print(x, y, z)

x: int, y: float, z: str = 1, 2.5, "Python" # Using type hints while assigning mutiple variables simultaneously cause and error invalid syntax

print(x, y, z)

"""## **Delete a Variable Using del Keyword**

We can remove a variable from the namespace using the del keyword. This effectively deletes the variable and frees up the memory it was using.
"""

# Assigning value to variable

x: int = 10
print(x)

# Removing the variable from memory using del keyword

del x

# Trying to print x after deletion will raise an error

# print(x) # Uncommenting this line will raise NameError: name 'x' is not defined

print(x) # NameError: name 'x' is not defined, because we already delete variable x (del x)

"""### Explanation:

`del` x removes the variable x from memory.
After deletion, trying to access the variable x results in a NameError, indicating that the variable no longer exists.
