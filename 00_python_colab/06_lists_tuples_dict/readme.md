# **Working with Lists and Tuples**

## **Introduction**

Python provides powerful sequence types: `lists and tuples`. These data structures help store and manage collections of data efficiently.

## **1. Lists in Python**

1. **Ordered**: Lists are `ordered`, meaning that the items in the list have a specific order and can be accessed by their index.
2. **Mutable**: Lists are `mutable`, meaning that they can be modified after they are created.
3. **Indexed**: Lists are `indexed`, meaning that each item in the list has a specific index that can be used to access it.
4. **Dynamic size**: Lists can `grow or shrink` dynamically as elements are added or removed.
5. **Heterogeneous**: Lists can contain elements of `different data types`, such as integers, strings, floats, and other lists.
6. **Supports duplicate values**: Lists can contain `duplicate values`.

Creating a List
"""

# Creating lists with different data types
fruits: list  = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers: list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
mixed: list   = ["hello", 42, 3.14, True]

print("fruits  = ", fruits)
print("numbers = ", numbers)
print("mixed   = ", mixed)

"""## **Accessing List Elements**

You can access elements using indexing (**starting from 0**) and negative indexing (**starting from -1**).
"""

fruits: list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])   # Output: apple
print(fruits[-3])  # Output: apple, accessing element in reverse order

"""## **Modifying Lists**

Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed.
"""

fruits: list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits[-3] = "watermelon" # replacing "apple" with "watermelon"
print(fruits)  # Output: ['watermelon', 'banana', 'cherry']

"""## **List Slicing**

Extract multiple elements using slicing.
"""

print(fruits[0:2])  # Output: ['watermelon', 'banana'] 0 and 1

"""## **2. Common List Methods**

Lists provide built-in methods for efficient data manipulation.

Appending and Extending Lists
"""

fruits.append("mango")  # Adds a single element 'mango' to the end
print(fruits)  # Output: ['watermelon', 'banana', 'cherry', 'mango']

fruits.extend(["grape", "kiwi"])  # Adds multiple elements
print(fruits)  # Output: ['watermelon', 'banana', 'cherry', 'mango', 'grape', 'kiwi']

"""## **Removing Elements**

In Python, `remove()` and `pop()` are two distinct methods used to manipulate lists. While they may seem similar, they have different purposes and behaviors.

**Remove() Method**

The `remove()` method is used to delete the first occurrence of a specified value from a list. If the value is not found in the list, a `ValueError` exception is raised.

**Key aspects of remove():**

1. **Value-based**: `remove()` searches for a specific value in the list.

2. **Returns None**: The `remove()` method does not return any value.
3. **Raises ValueError**: If the value is not found in the list, a `ValueError` exception is raised.
"""

fruits.remove("banana")  # Removes 'banana' # run multiple times to see error as "banana" is already removed
print(fruits)

"""## **Pop() Method**

The `pop()` method is used to delete an item at a specified index from a list. If no index is provided, it removes and returns the last item in the list.

**Key aspects of pop():**

1. **Index-based**: `pop()` searches for an item at a specific index in the list.

2. **Returns the removed item**: The `pop()` method returns the item that was removed from the list.
3. **Raises IndexError**: If the index is out of range, an `IndexError` exception is raised.
"""

deleted = fruits.pop(1)  # Removes and returns the element at index 1 # run it multiple time to see error
print("deleted element = ", deleted)  # Output: 'cherry'
print(fruits) # Output: ['watermelon', 'mango', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'mango']

"""## **Sorting a List**"""

numbers: list[int] = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9] # unsorted list
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]

numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)  # Output: [9, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1]

"""## **3. Iterating Over Lists**

Use loops to process elements in a list.


**Using a for-loop**
"""

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# **Using list comprehension**

List comprehension is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to create new lists in a `concise` and `readable way`. It's a `compact way` to create lists from existing lists or other iterables by applying a transformation or filter to each element.

```python
new_list = [expression for element in iterable if condition]
```

* `expression` is the operation you want to perform on each element.
* `element` is the variable that takes on the value of each element in the `iterable`.
* `iterable` is the list or other iterable that you want to process.
* `condition` is an optional filter that determines whether an element is included in the new list.
"""

# Without if condition
squared: list = [x**2 for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ] #  if x > 3 place this if condition and see
print(squared, " : ", type(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# With if condition
squared: list = [x**2 for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] if x > 3] #  if x > 3 place this if condition and see
print(squared, " : ", type(squared))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

"""**List comprehension is commonly used for:**

* **`Transforming data`**: List comprehension can be used to transform data from one format to another.
* **`Filtering data`**: List comprehension can be used to filter out unwanted data.
* **`Creating new data`**: List comprehension can be used to create new data by combining existing data.

[w3schools: List Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_methods.asp)

# **4. Tuples in Python**

A tuple is an `ordered`, `immutable` (unchangeable) sequence of elements. Tuples are useful for fixed data collections.

In Python, a tuple is an immutable data type. This means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.

### **1.  Cannot Modify Elements:**
  * Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its elements.

### **2. Cannot Add or Remove Elements:**
  * You cannot add new elements to a tuple or remove existing ones.



---



## **Why Use Tuples?**

  1.  **Immutable**: Since tuples cannot be changed, they are safer to use when you want to ensure that the data remains constant.

  2.  **Hashable**: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are immutable.
  3.  **Performance**: Tuples are generally faster than lists because of their immutability.

## **When to Use Tuples vs Lists**

* Use tuples when you want to store data that should not change (e.g., coordinates, constants).

* Use lists when you need a collection that can be modified (e.g., adding or removing elements).

Creating a Tuple
"""

tuple1: tuple = tuple(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]) # cast a list into tuple
tuple2: tuple = (10, 20, 30) # tuple
mixed_tuple: tuple = ("hello", 42, 3.14, True) # tuple

print("tuple1      =", tuple1)
print("tuple2      =", tuple2)
print("mixed_tuple =", mixed_tuple)

"""Even though tuples are immutable, Python may create new instances in memory when you define identical tuples in separate assignments. This is why id(tuple_1) and id(tuple_2) may differ."""

tuple_1: tuple = (10, 20, 30) # tuple
tuple_2: tuple = (10, 20, 30) # tuple

print("id(tuple_1) = ", id(tuple_1)) # unique memory address
print("id(tuple_2) = ", id(tuple_2)) # unique memory address

print("tuple_1 == tuple_2 = ", tuple_1 == tuple_2) # comparing by value

"""**Why are Tuples Immutable?**

There are several reasons why tuples are immutable:

1. **`Memory Efficiency`**: Immutable tuples can be stored in a single block of memory, which makes them more memory-efficient than lists.
2. **`Thread Safety`**: Immutable tuples are thread-safe, meaning that they can be safely accessed and shared between multiple threads without fear of modification.
3. **`Hashability`**: Immutable tuples are hashable, meaning that they can be used as keys in dictionaries.

## **Python is Type Hint Language**
"""

"""## **Type Hinting (a: int)**
* a: int is a type hint, which suggests that the variable a is expected to be an integer.
* `However, type hints are not enforced in Python`. They are only for documentation and tools like linters or type checkers.
* The actual value assigned to a will still be a string, because input() always returns a string.

# **Dictionaries in Python**

## **1. Introduction to Dictionaries**

A dictionary is a collection of `key-value pairs`. It is:


- **Ordered (since Python 3.7)**: Items are stored in the order they were inserted.

- **Mutable**: Items can be added, removed, or modified after the dictionary is created.
- **Un-indexed**: Items are accessed using keys, not indices.
- **Without duplicates**: **`Keys must be unique`**, but values can be duplicated.


Before Python 3.7, dictionaries were **unordered**, meaning that items were not stored in a specific order. However, with the introduction of Python 3.7, dictionaries now maintain their insertion order.

[OrderedDict vs dict in Python: The Right Tool for the Job](https://realpython.com/python-ordereddict/)

## **2. Creating a Dictionary**

Dictionaries are created using curly braces {} with key-value pairs separated by commas.

The syntax is:

``` Python
dictionary = {key1: value1, key2: value2, ...}
```

Example Code:
"""

# prompt: genrate a List of 5 american cities

american_cities: dict = ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago", "Houston", "Phoenix"]
american_cities

# Create a dictionary to store a person's details
person: dict = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "visited_cities": american_cities
}
print(person)

thisdict: dict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway") # It is also possible to use the dict() constructor to make a dictionary.
print(type(thisdict)," - ", thisdict, )

"""## **3. Accessing Values**
You can access the value associated with a key using square brackets [] or the get() method.


Example Code:
"""

# Access values using keys
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice
print(person.get("age", "99"))  # Output: 25, if not found it will return 99 (default value)

# Access a non-existent key
print(person.get("country", "my_default_vlaue_if_key_not_found"))  # Output: my_default_vlaue (default value)

"""## **4. Modifying a Dictionary**


You can add new key-value pairs or modify existing ones.

Example Code:
"""

# Add a new key-value pair
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"
print(person)

# Modify an existing value
person["age"] = 26
print(person)

"""## **5. Deleting Items**


You can remove a key-value pair using the del keyword or the pop() method.

Note that `pop()` returns the value of the removed key-value pair, whereas `del` does not return anything.

You can also use `pop()` with a default value, in case the key is not found in the dictionary:

Example Code:
"""

person: dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'email': 'alice@example.com', 'city': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix']}
print(person)

# Remove a key-value pair using del
del person["city"]
print(person)

# Remove a key-value pair using pop
age: int = person.pop("age", -1)
print("Removed age:", age)
print(person)

print("\n-----\n")
#Again remove a key which is already removed to check the default value
age: int = person.pop("age", -1)
print("key 'age' not found in dict so returning default value: ", age)

"""## **6. Dictionary Methods**

Python provides several useful methods for working with dictionaries.


| Method   | Description                                                       |   |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| keys()   | Returns a list of all keys in the dictionary.                     |   |
| values() | Returns a list of all values in the dictionary.                   |   |
| items()  | Returns a list of key-value pairs as tuples.                      |   |
| clear()  | Removes all items from the dictionary.                            |   |
| update() | Adds or updates multiple key-value pairs from another dictionary. |   |
"""

# Get all keys
print("person.keys()         = ", person.keys()  )  # Output: dict_keys(['name', 'email', 'city', 'age'])

# Get all values
print("person.values()       = ", person.values())  # Output: dict_values(['Alice', 'alice@example.com', 'Los Angeles', 27])

# Get all key-value pairs
print("person.items()        = ", person.items())  # Output: dict_items([('name', 'Alice'), ('email', 'alice@example.com'), ('city', 'Los Angeles'), ('age', 27)])

# Update the dictionary
person.update({"city": "Los Angeles", "age": 27})
print("After: person.update  = ", person)

# Clear the dictionary
person.clear()
print("After: person.clear() = ", person)  # Output: {}

"""## **Duplicate Key Not Allowed**


Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:
"""

thisdict: dict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020 # this will overwrite the previous key:vlaue
}
print(thisdict)

"""## **7. Iterating Over a Dictionary**

You can loop through a dictionary using for loops.

Example Code:
"""

for key in thisdict:
    print(key)

for key, value in thisdict.items():
    print(key," : ", value)

"""## **8. Practical Examples**

Here are two practical examples to solidify these concepts.

Example 1: Building a Phonebook
"""

# Create a phonebook
phonebook: dict = {
    "Alice": "123-456-7890",
    "Bob": "987-654-3210",
    "Charlie": "555-555-5555"
}

# Add a new contact
phonebook["David"] = "111-222-3333"

# Search for a contact
name: str = input("Enter a name to search: ")
if name in phonebook:
    print(f"{name}'s phone number is {phonebook[name]}.")
else:
    print(f"{name} is not in the phonebook.")
